# Create a new workitem and link it to your Pull request

Have you ever come across a situation where you created a Pull request but forgot to create a work item for it. Now you can quickly create a workitem and associate it to your Pull request right from the PR page.

Just click on the new "Link to a new workitem" menu item to open a work item dialog. Enter the work item details in the dialog and hit save and this extension will automatically link the new workitem with your Pull request.

P.S. - The extension creates the work item and adds the link using Rest API, so the Pull request page wont show the new linked workitem right away. You'll need to refresh the page to see it.
